# bb8
This repository is a set of bash and Python scripts that wrap around rsync.

# Configuration
bb8 backs up data to another server, which we call the Starport, via ssh.
Before running any scripts, bb8 needs a JSON configuration file. It should live in this repo at `./etc/config.json`.

## Sample configuration file
Here's a sample configuration file. It should be mostly self explanatory.

```
{
    "starport_addr": "annex.montagu.dide.ic.ac.uk",
    "starport_user": "montagu",
    "starport_backup_location": "testrsync/",
    "targets": [
        {
            "type": "directory",
            "name": "test",
            "path": "/testrsync/"
        }
    ]
}

```

## Targets
Targets are what should be backed up (and restored). Each target must specify a
"type", which can be `directory` or `named_volume`. Each of these
requires further options.

### Directory
Simplest option. Requires a `path` to a directory.

### Named volume TODO
Requires the `name` of the volume.

# Scripts
So that bb8 can communicate with the Starport via ssh,
 we first need to generate a key pair which we store in the vault, then add the public key to the authorized_keys
 file on Starport. This is done by running `./setup_starport.sh` on the Starport. To run backups
  bb8 needs the corresponding private key and a JSON configuration file.
 When bb8 has been configured, these live in this repo at `./etc/config.json` and `./etc/id_rsa`, respectively.
There are five entrypoints to the backup module.

1. `setup_starport.sh`: To be run on Starport. So that bb8 can communicate with the Starport via ssh,
 we first need to generate a key pair which
 we store in the vault, then add the public key to the authorized_keys
 file on Starport. You will be prompted for Vault (GitHub) access token. Should be run as the user you want to connect
 via ssh with.
2. `setup.sh`: This installs any dependencies, checks that a config file exists,
 then reads the private key from the vault and stores it in this repo at
`./etc`. You will be prompted for Vault (GitHub) access token. Need to run as root.
3. `backup.py`: Runs a one-off backup. Output is logged to this repo at `./log/.` Need to run as root.
4. `schedule.py`: TODO
5. `restore.py`:  TODO
